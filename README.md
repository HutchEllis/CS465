# CS465
Full Stack Development
# Architecture
The project is based on the MEAN stack.
<br/>M - MongoDB databade is used to store user data, travel information, and admin data.
E - Express.js framework is used to handle routing and to integrate data from MongoDB.
A - Angular is used for the frontend framework to build the Single Page Application (SPA).
N - Node.js is used to execute server-side code.

The Single Page Application (SPA) does not require page reloads compared to the webpages created using Express.
This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage depending on the size of the Single Page Application because it requires everything to load up front which can lead to extensive load times if the file is large.
